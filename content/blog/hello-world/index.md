description: The very first version of my personal site
---

```JavaScript
console.log('lewischan.dev: Hello world');
```

Finally, I have gotten the first version of my personal site published. 

Over the past few 2 weeks, I spent time tuning the Gatsby blog template, 
it isn't finalised yet, more is to come.

I will continuously document the changes I implement on this site, and update
here in the blog. 

Stay tuned.
