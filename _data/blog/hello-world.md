metaDescription: The very first version of my personal site

```JavaScript
console.log('lewischan.dev: Hello world');
```

Finally, the first version of my personal site is published.

Over the past few 2 weeks, I spent time tuning the Gatsby blog template,
it isn't finalised yet.

I will continuously document the changes I implement on this blog.

Stay tuned.
